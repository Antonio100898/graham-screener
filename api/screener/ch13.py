"""Chapter-13 comparison statistics derived from the annual EPS series.

Graham compares smoothed three-year earning-power levels roughly five and ten
years apart, tests stability as the worst decline against the trailing three-year
average, and asks for positive earnings in every one of the last ten years.
Everything here is arithmetic over the audited annual series — no criterion, no
verdict. A statistic whose input years are missing is omitted, never guessed:
each result names the years it rests on so the reader can see the basis.
