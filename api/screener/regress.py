"""What an engine change did to every number, before it is shipped.

The unit tests pin about 320 synthetic fixtures. The product is 5,892 real
companies times some forty figures each, and the gap between those two is where
every defect in this engine has lived: a share count that moved for 62 filers, a
criterion resurrected after the engine withheld it, an option pool of 1.3 billion
per cent. Each was found by hand-writing a one-off comparison script, and three of
those scripts were themselves wrong — they forgot the dimensioned sidecar, or the
cover ratio, and reported companies as broken that were fine.

So the comparison lives here instead, built once, calling exactly what `derive`
calls. It recomputes a sample against the shipped dashboard and reports what moved,
bucketed by field. It answers the only question that matters after a change: did
this fix the eleven companies it was meant to fix, and what else did it touch?
